# Preface

Coevolution, the reciprocal evolutionary influence between two or more interacting species, underpins the diversity and complexity of ecosystems. However, understanding coevolution in empirical systems is challenging because of the different time scales at which coevolution operates. Mathematical models, in turn, enable us to simulate various scenarios, predict outcomes, and test hypotheses, providing a deeper understanding of how coevolution shapes biodiversity, ecological stability, and the emergence of new traits. Therefore, the main goal of the course is to introduce the basic concepts and tools that can be used to model coevolution in ecological communities. To do so, the course is divided into two blocks. In the first block, we will introduce the main concepts and the mathematical foundations of evolutionary biology that will be used to model coevolution. For the second block we will provide an overview on how to build coevolutionary models from basic evolutionary and ecological principles. The coevolutionary models covered in the course can be applied to both discrete and continuously varying traits, for instance, the frequency of different flower color morphs in a population of plants or the length of their floral tube, respectively. Furthermore, we will demonstrate how to progress the coevolutionary models from isolated pairwise of interacting species to entire communities that form networks. Conceptual lectures will occur in the morning, from 10:00-12:00am. The conceptual lectures will be followed by an exercise section in the afternoon, from 14:00-17:00pm, where the models will be implemented via computer simulations and analyzed.

## Usage

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

## Render book

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1.  Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

2.  Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
